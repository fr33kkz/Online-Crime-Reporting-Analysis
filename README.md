# Online-Crime-Reporting-Analysis
Built a webpage and a machine learning model in which the user can report any crime online and also look at the analysis of the crimes happening around him/city. The Machine Learning Algorithm tries to understand the data and predicts/gives out the information about the crimes which took place and the crimes which may happen.
